# Stats Project

This project generates a json file with stats about the numbers of files of some problems by users.

Is a clone of the project "Retos de programacion" by [MoureDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNtcTmCiXzw)

This project was created to learn how to work with github actions.

There are two actions:
* One action executes with every push (SP)
* Other action executes with a cron (SC)
